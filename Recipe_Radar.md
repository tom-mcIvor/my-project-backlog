Product Requirements Document: RecipeRadar
1. Product Overview
RecipeRadar is a web application that solves the common problem of "what to cook with what I have." The platform allows users to input ingredients they already have in their kitchen and instantly receive personalized recipe recommendations based on those ingredients.
Unlike other recipe sites that require searching for specific dishes, RecipeRadar starts with what users already have and builds suggestions from there, reducing food waste and simplifying meal planning. The app combines a clean, user-friendly interface with intelligent recipe matching to transform the cooking experience from a chore to a creative and satisfying activity.
